# r-leaflet-groupedlayercontrol-example
This R code demonstrates adding leaflet-groupedlayercontrol that extend layer grouping and selection, allowing a ton of flexibiliy in determining what layers are shown. Have a look at the output folder which shows the result of running the R script. You should be able to test out the map without running any code by opening the html file YOUR_MAP.html within the output folder. 

# Why groupedlayercontrol?
The [leaflet-groupedlayercontrol](https://github.com/ismyrnow/leaflet-groupedlayercontrol) add-on provides a nice solution for grouping overlay layers. You can:
- Create exclusive group (handy for only showing just one choropleth overlay at a time,
- Create multiple grouped layers. 
- Ability to have multiple group titles shown in the layer menu.
- Able to toggle all group layers on or off with a single checkbox click. 
- Able to toggle individual layers on or off.
